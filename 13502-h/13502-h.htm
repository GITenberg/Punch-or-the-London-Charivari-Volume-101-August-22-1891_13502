    <h2>THE TRAVELLING COMPANIONS.</h2>

    <h3>No. III.</h3>

    <blockquote>
        <p>SCENE&mdash;<i>On the Coach from Braine l'Alleud to
        Waterloo. The vehicle has a Belgian driver, but the
        conductor is a true-born Briton.</i> Mr. CYRUS K. TROTTER
        <i>and his daughter are behind with</i> PODBURY. CULCHARD,
        <i>who is not as yet sufficiently on speaking terms with
        his friend to ask for an introduction, is on the box-seat
        in front.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Mr. Trotter</i>. How are you getting along, MAUD? Your
    seat pretty comfortable?</p>

    <p><i>Miss Trotter</i>. Well, I guess it would be about as
    luxurious if it hadn't got a chunk of wood nailed down the
    middle&mdash;it's not going to have anyone confusing it with a
    bed of roses <i>just</i> yet. (<i>To</i> PODB.) Your friend mad
    about anything? He don't seem to open his head more'n he's
    obliged to. I presume he don't approve of your taking up with
    me and Father&mdash;he keeps away from us considerable, I
    notice.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>awkwardly</i>). Oh&mdash;er&mdash;I
    wouldn't say that, but he's a queer kind of chap rather, takes
    prejudices into his head and all that. I wouldn't trouble about
    him if I were you&mdash;not worth it, y' know.</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> Thanks&mdash;but it isn't going to shorten my
    existence any.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[CULCH. <i>overhears all this, with feelings that may be
        imagined.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Belgian Driver</i> (<i>to his horses</i>). Pullep! Allez
    vîte! Bom-bom-bom! Alright!</p>

    <p><i>Conductor</i> (<i>to</i> CULCHARD). 'E's very proud of
    'is English, <i>'e</i> is. 'Ere, JEWLS, ole feller, show the
    gen'lm'n 'ow yer can do a swear. (<i>Belgian Driver utters a
    string of English imprecations with the utmost fluency and
    good-nature.</i>) 'Ark at 'im now! Bust my frogs!
    (<i>Admiringly, and not without a sense of the appropriateness
    of the phrase.</i>) But he's a caution, Sir, ain't he? <i>I</i>
    taught him most o' what he knows!</p>

    <p><i>A French Passenger</i> (<i>to Conductor</i>). Dis done,
    mon ami, est-ce qu'on peut voir d'ici le champ de bataille?</p>

    <p><i>Conductor</i> (<i>with proper pride</i>). It ain't no use
    your torkin to <i>me</i>, Mossoo; I don't speak no French
    myself. (<i>To</i> CULCHARD.) See that field there, Sir?</p>

    <p><i>Culchard</i> (<i>interested</i>). On the right? Yes, what
    happened <i>there</i>?</p>

    </div>

    <p><i>Cond.</i> Fine lot o' rabbits inside o' there&mdash;big
    fat 'uns. (<i>To another Passenger</i>.) No, Sir, that ain't
    Belly Lions as you see from 'ere; that's Mon Sin Jeean, and
    over there Oogymong, and Chalyroy to the left.</p>

    <h4>ON THE TOP OF THE MOUND.</h4>

    <blockquote>
        <p>CULCHARD, <i>who has purchased a map in the Waterloo
        Museum as a means of approaching</i> Miss TROTTER, <i>is
        pounced upon by an elderly Belgian Guide in a blue blouse,
        from whom he finds it difficult to escape.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>The Guide</i> (<i>fixing</i> CULCHARD <i>with a pair of
    rheumy eyes and a gnarled forefinger</i>). You see vere is dat
    schmall voodt near de vite 'ouse? not dere, along my
    shdeek&mdash;so. Dat is vare PEECTON vas kill, Inglis Officer,
    PEECTON. Two days pefore he vas voundet in de ahum. 'E say to
    his sairvan', "You dell ennipoddies, I keel you!" He vandt to
    pe in ze bataille: he <i>vas</i> in ze bataille&mdash;seven
    lance troo im, seven; PEECTON, Inglis Officer. (CULCHARD
    <i>nods his head miserably.</i>) Hah, you 'ave de shart
    dere&mdash;open 'im out vide, dat de odder shentilmans see.
    (CULCHARD <i>obeys, spell-bound.</i>) Vare you see dat blue
    gross, Vaterloo Shirshe, vere Loart UXBREEDGE lose 'is laig.
    Zey cot 'im off and pury him in ze cott-yardt, and a villow
    grow oudt of 'im. 'E com 'ere to see the villow growing oudt of
    his laig.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>abandoning his map, and edging towards</i>
    Miss TROTTER). Hem&mdash;we are gazing upon one of the
    landmarks of our national history&mdash;Miss TROTTER.</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> That's a vurry interesting re-mark. I presume
    you must have studied up some for a reflection of that kind.
    Mr. PODBURY, your friend has been telling me&mdash; [<i>She
    repeats</i> CULCHARD's <i>remark.</i></p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>with interest</i>). Got any <i>more</i> of
    those, old fellow?</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[CULCHARD <i>moves away with disgusted hauteur.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>The Guide</i> (<i>re-capturing him</i>). Along dat gross
    vay, VELLAINTON meet BLUSHAIR. Prussian général, BLUSHAIR,
    VELLAINTON 'e com hier. I see 'im. Ven 'e see ze maundt 'e vos
    vair angri. 'E say, "Eet is no ze battle-fiel' no more&mdash;I
    com back nevare!" Zat aidge is vere de Scots Greys vas. Ven
    they dell NAPOLEON 'oo zey are, 'e say. "Fine
    mens&mdash;splendid mens, I feenish dem in von hour!" SOULT 'e
    say, "Ah, Sire, you do not know dose dairible grey 'orses!"
    NAPOLEON 'e <i>not</i> know dem. SOULT 'e meet dem at de
    Peninsulaire&mdash;'e know dem. In dat Shirsh, dventy, dirty
    dablets to Inglis officers. NAPOLEON 'e coaled op 'is laift
    vink, zey deploy in line, vair you see my shdeek&mdash;ha, ze
    shentelman is gone avay vonce more!</p>

    <p><i>Miss Trotter</i> (<i>to</i> CULCHARD, <i>who has found
    himself unable to keep away</i>). You don't seem to find that
    old gentleman vurry good company?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> The fact is that I much prefer to receive my
    impressions of a scene like this in solitude.</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> <i>I</i> should have thought you'd be too
    polite to tell me so; but I was moving on, anyway.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>She goes on. Before</i> CULCHARD <i>can follow and
        explain, he finds himself accosted by</i> Mr. TROTTER.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Mr. T.</i> I don't know as I'm as much struck by this
    Waterloo field as I expected, Sir. As an Amurrcan, I find it
    doesn't come up to some of our battlefields in the War. We
    don't blow about those battlefields, Sir, but for style and
    general picturesqueness, I ain't seen nothing <i>this</i> side
    to equal them. You ever been over? You want to come over and
    see our country&mdash;that's what <i>you</i> want to do. You
    mustn't mind me a-running on, but when I meet someone as I can
    converse with in my own language&mdash;well, I just about talk
    myself dry.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>He talks himself dry, until rejoined by the</i>
        Guide <i>with</i> PODBURY <i>and</i> Miss TROTTER.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Guide</i> (<i>to</i> PODBURY). Leesten, I dell you. My
    vader&mdash;eighteen, no in ze Airmi, laboreur man&mdash;he see
    NAPOLÉON standt in a saircle; officers roundt 'im. Boots, op to
    hier; green cott; vite vaiscott; vite laigs&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Podbury</i>. Your father's legs?</p>

    <p><i>Guide</i>. No, Sare; my vader see NAPOLÉON's laigs;
    leedle 'at, qvite plain; no faither&mdash;nossing.</p>

    <p><i>Podbury</i>. But you just said you <i>had</i> a
    faither!</p>

    <p><i>Guide</i>. I say, NAPOLÉON 'ad no faither&mdash;vat you
    call it?&mdash;<i>plume</i>&mdash;in 'is 'at, at ze
    bataille.</p>

    <p><i>Podbury</i>. Are you sure? I thought the history books
    said he "stuck a feather in his hat, and called it
    Macaroni."</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> I presume you're thinking of our National
    Amurrcan character, Yankee Doodle?</p>

    <p><i>Guide</i>. My vader, 'e no see NAPOLÉON viz a Yankedoodle
    in 'is 'at; 'e vear nossing.</p>

    <p><i>Podbury</i>. Nothing? What became of the green coat and
    white waistcoat, then, eh?</p>

    <p><i>Guide</i>. Ah, you unnerstan' nossing at all! Leesten, I
    dell you vonce more. My vader&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Podbury</i>. No, look here, my friend; you go and tell
    <i>that</i> gentleman all about it (<i>indicating</i>
    CULCHARD); he's very interested in hearing what NAPOLEON wore
    or didn't wear.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>The</i> Guide <i>takes possession of</i> CULCHARD
        <i>once more, who submits, under the impression that</i>
        Miss TROTTER <i>is a fellow-sufferer.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Guide</i> (<i>concluding a vivid account of the fight at
    Houguymont</i>). Bot ven zey com qvite nearer, zey vind ze rade
    line no ze Inglis soldiers&mdash;nossing bot a breek vall, viz
    ze moskets&mdash;'Prown Pesses,' you coal dem&mdash;shdeekin
    out of ze 'oles! Ze 'oles schdill dere. Dat vas Houguymont, in
    the orshairde. Now you com viz me and see ze lion. Ze dail, two
    piece; ze bodi, von piece; ze ball, von piece. I sank you,
    Sare. 'Ope you com again soon.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[CULCHARD <i>discovers that the</i> TROTTERS <i>and</i>
        PODBURY <i>have gone down some time ago. At the foot of the
        steps he finds his friend waiting for him, alone.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Culch</i>. (<i>with stiff politeness</i>). Sorry you
    considered it necessary to stay behind on my account. I see
    your American friends have already started for the station.</p>

    <p><i>Podbury</i> (<i>gloomily</i>). There were only two seats
    on that coach, and they wouldn't wait for the next. I don't
    know why, unless it was that they saw you coming down the
    steps. She can't stand you at any price.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>with some heat</i>). Just as likely she
    had had enough of your buffoonery!</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>with provoking good humour</i>). Come, old
    chap, don't get your shirt out with me. Not my fault if she's
    found out you think yourself too big a swell for her, is
    it?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>hotly</i>). When did I say so&mdash;or
    think so? It's what you've told her about me, and I must say I
    call it&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Don't talk bosh! Who said she was forward and
    bad form and all the rest of it in the courtyard that first
    evening? She was close by, and heard every word of it, I
    shouldn't wonder.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>colouring</i>). It's not of vital
    importance if she did. (<i>Whistling.</i>)
    Few-fee-fee-foo-foodle-di-fee-di-fa-foo.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Not a bit&mdash;to her. Better step out if we
    mean to catch that train. (<i>Humming.</i>)
    La-di-loodle-lumpty-leedle-um-ti-loo!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>They step out</i>, PODBURY <i>humming pleasantly
        and</i> CULCHARD <i>whistling viciously, without further
        conversation, until they arrive at Braine l'Alleud
        Station&mdash;and discover that they have just missed their
        train.</i></p>

    <p>QUEER QUERIES.&mdash;HYMENEAL.&mdash;I have been asked to
    attend the wedding of a friend, and respond to the toast of
    "The Ladies." I have never done such a thing before, and feel
    rather nervous about it. My friend says that I must "try and be
    very comic." I have thought of one humorous remark&mdash;about
    the "weaker sex" being really stronger&mdash;which I fancy will
    be effective, but I can't think of another. Would <i>one</i>
    good joke of that sort be sufficient? <i>À propos</i> of the
    lady marksman at Bisley, I should like to advise all ladies to
    "try the Butts," only I am afraid this might be taken for a
    reference to the President of the Divorce Division. How could I
    work the Jackson case in neatly? Would it be allowable to pin
    my speech on the wedding-cake, and read it off? Also, could I
    wear a mask? Any hints would be welcomed by&mdash;BEST MAN.</p>

    8·15, 9·15, or 10, are "indistinct."</p>

    <h4>CHAPTER I.</h4>

    <p>I am sitting, fatigued, in my study. I have not taken a
    holiday this year, or last, for the matter of that. Others
    have; I haven't. Work! work! work!&mdash;and I am wishing that
    my goose-quills were wings ("so appropriate!" whisper my
    good-natured friends behind their hands to one another), so
    that I might fly away and be at rest. To this they (the
    goose-quills, not the friends) have often assisted me ere now.
    Suddenly, as I sit "a-thinking, a-thinking," my door is opened,
    and, without any announcement, there stands before me a slight
    figure, of middle height, in middle age, nothing remarkable
    about his dress, nothing remarkable about his greyish hair and
    close-cut beard, but something very remarkable about his eyes,
    which sparkle with intelligence and energy; and something still
    more remarkable about the action of his arms, hands, and thin,
    wiry fingers, which suggests the idea of his being an animated
    semaphore worked by a galvanic battery, telegraphing signals
    against time at the rate of a hundred words a minute, the
    substantives being occasionally expressed, but mostly
    "understood,"&mdash;pronouns and prepositions being omitted
    wholesale.</p>

    <p>"What! DAUBINET!" I exclaim, he being the last person I had
    expected to see, having, indeed, a letter on my desk from him,
    dated yesterday and delivered this morning, to that he was
    then, at the moment of writing, and practically therefore for
    the next forty-eight hours&mdash;at least; so it would be with
    any ordinary individual&mdash;in Edinburgh. But DAUBINET is not
    an ordinary individual, and the ordinary laws of motion to and
    from any given point do not apply to him. He is a Flying
    Frenchman&mdash;here, there, and everywhere; especially
    everywhere. So mercurial, that he will be in advance of Mercury
    himself, and having written a letter in the morning to say he
    is coming, it is not unlikely that he will travel by the next
    train, arrive before the letter, and then wonder that you
    weren't prepared to receive him. Such, in a brief sketch, is
    <i>mon ami</i> DAUBINET.</p>

             Flying Frenchman."
    </div>

    <p>"Aha! <i>me voici!</i>" he cries, shaking my hand warmly.
    Then he sings, waving his hat in his left hand, and still
    grasping my right with his, "<i>Voici le sabre de mon
    père!</i>" which reminiscence of OFFENBACH has no particular
    relevancy to anything at the present moment; but it evidently
    lets off some of his superfluous steam. He continues, always
    with my hand in his, "<i>J'arrive! inattendu! Mais, mon
    cher</i>,"&mdash;here he turns off the French stop of his
    polyglot organ, and, as it were, turns on the English
    stop,&mdash;continuing his address to me in very
    distinctly-pronounced English, "I wrote to you to say I would
    be here," then pressing the French stop, he concludes with,
    "<i>ce matin, n'est-ce pas?</i>"</p>

    <p>"<i>Parfaitement, mon cher</i>," I reply, giving myself a
    chance of airing a little French, being on perfectly safe
    ground, as he thoroughly understands English; indeed, he
    understands several languages, and, if I flounder out of my
    depth in foreign waters, one stroke will bring me safe on to
    the British rock of intelligibility again; or, if I obstinately
    persist in floundering, and am searching for the word as for a
    plank, he will jump in and rescue me. Under these
    circumstances, I am perfectly safe in talking French to him
    "<i>Mais je ne vous attendais ce matin</i>"&mdash;I've got an
    idea that this is something uncommonly grammatical&mdash;"<i>à
    cause de votre lettre que je viens de recevoir</i>"&mdash;this,
    I'll swear, is idiomatic&mdash;"<i>ce matin. La voilà!</i>" I
    pride myself on "<i>La</i>," as representing my knowledge that
    "<i>lettre</i>," to which it refers, is feminine.</p>

    <p>"<i>Caramba!</i>" he exclaims&mdash;an exclamation which, I
    have every reason to suppose, from want of more definite
    information, is Spanish. "<i>Caramba!</i> that letter is from
    Edinburgh; <i>j'ai visité</i> Glasgow, the <i>Nord et partout,
    et je suis de retour</i>, I am going on business to Reims,
    <i>pour revenir par Paris,&mdash;si vous voudrez me donner le
    plaisir de votre compagnie&mdash;de Jeudi prochain à
    Mardi&mdash;vous serez mon invité,&mdash;et je serai charmé,
    très charmé.</i>"</p>

             alt="'Au revoir!'" /></a>"Au revoir!"
    </div>

    <p>Being already carried away in imagination to Reims, and
    returning by Paris, I am at once inclined to reply,</p>

    <p>"<i>Enchanté!</i> with the greatest pleasure."</p>

    <p>"<i>Hoch! Hoch! Hurrá!</i>" he cries, by way of response,
    waving his hat. Then he sings loudly, "And&mdash;bless the
    Prince of WALES!" After which, being rather proud of his
    mastery of Cockneyisms, he changes the accent, still singing,
    "Blaass the Prince of WAILES!" which he considers his <i>chef
    d'oeuvre</i> as an imitation of a genuine Cockney tone, to
    which it bears exactly such resemblance as does a scene of
    ordinary London life drawn by a French artist. Then he says,
    seriously&mdash;"<i>Eh bien! allons! C'est fixé</i>&mdash;it is
    fixed. We meet Victoria, <i>et alors, par</i> London, Chatham
    &amp; Dover, from Reims <i>viâ</i> Calais, <i>très
    bien,&mdash;train d'onze heures précises,&mdash;bien entendu.
    J'y suis. Ihr Diener! Adios! A reverderla! Addio, amico
    caro!</i>" Then he utters something which is between a sneeze
    and a growl, supposed to be a term of endearment in the Russian
    tongue. Finally he says in English, "Good-bye!"</p>

    <p>His hat is on in a jiffy (which I take to be the hundredth
    part of a second) and he is down the stairs into the hall, and
    out at the door "like a flying light comedian" with an airy
    "go" about him, which recalls to my mind the running exits of
    CHARLES WYNDHAM in one of his lightest comedy-parts. "<i>Au
    revoir! Pour Jeudi alors!</i>" I hear him call this out in the
    hall; the door bangs as if a firework had exploded and blown my
    vivacious friend up into the air, and he has gone.</p>

    <p>"<i>Jeudi alors</i>" arrives, and I am at Victoria for the
    eleven o'clock Express to the minute, having decided that this
    is the best, shortest, and cheapest holiday I can take. I've
    never yet travelled with my excellent French friend DAUBINET. I
    am to be his guest; all responsibility is taken off my
    shoulders except that of my ticket and luggage, and to travel
    without responsibility is in itself a novelty. To have to think
    of nothing and nobody, not even of oneself! Away! away!</p>

    <p>DEAR MR. PUNCH,&mdash;As Englishmen are so often accused of
    want of originality, I hope you will let me call your attention
    to an occasion when it was conclusively proved that at least
    two of the British race were free from the reproach. The date
    to which I refer was the 1st of August last, when "a new and
    original drama," entitled <i>The Trumpet Call</i>, was produced
    at the Royal Adelphi Theatre, and the two exceptions to the
    general rule then proclaimed were Messrs. GEORGE R. SIMS and
    ROBERT BUCHANAN, its authors. The plot of this truly new and
    original piece is simple in the extreme. <i>Cuthbertson</i>, a
    young gentleman, has married his wife in the belief that his
    Wife No. 1 (of whom he has lost sight), is dead. Having thus
    ceased to be a widower, <i>Cuthbertson</i> is confronted by
    Wife No. 1 and deserts Wife No. 2. Assured by the villain of
    the piece that she is not really married to <i>Cuthbertson</i>,
    Wife No. 2 prepares to marry her informant. The nuptials are
    about to be celebrated in the Chapel Royal, Savoy, when enter
    Wife No. 1 who explains that she was a married woman when she
    met <i>Cuthbertson</i>, and therefore, a fair, or rather
    unfair, bigamist. Upon this <i>Cuthbertson</i> (who is
    conveniently near in a pew, wearing the unpretentious uniform
    of the Royal Horse Artillery), rushes into the arms of the lady
    who has erroneously been numbered Wife No. 2, when she has been
    in reality Wife No. 1, and all is joy. Now I need scarcely
    point out to you that nothing like this has ever been seen on
    the stage before. It is a marvel to me how Messrs. SIMS and
    BUCHANAN came to think of such clever things.</p>

             alt="An Altared Scene." /></a>An Altared Scene.
    </div>

    <p>But if it had been only the plot that was original, I should
    not have been so anxious to direct attention to <i>The Trumpet
    Call</i>. But the incidents and characters are equally novel.
    For instance, unlike <i>The Lights o' London</i>, there is a
    caravan and a showman. Next, unlike <i>In the Ranks</i>, there
    are scenes of barrack-life that are full of freshness and
    originality. In <i>Harbour Lights</i>, if my memory does not
    play me false, the hero enlisted in the Guards, in <i>The
    Trumpet Call</i> he joins the Royal Horse Artillery. Then,
    again, unlike the scene in the New Cut in <i>The Lights o'
    London</i>, there is a view by night of the exterior of the
    Mogul Music Hall. Further, there is a "Doss House" scene, that
    did not for a moment (or certainly not for more than a moment)
    recall to my mind that gathering of the poor in the dark arches
    of a London bridge, in one of BOUCICAULT's pieces. By the way,
    was that play, <i>After Dark</i>, or was it <i>The Streets of
    London</i>? I really forget which. Then, all the characters in
    the new play are absolutely new and original. The hero who will
    bear everything for his alleged wife's sake, and weeps over his
    child, is quite new. So is the heroine who takes up her
    residence with poor but amusing showmen, instead of wealthy
    relatives. That is also quite new, and there was nothing like
    it in <i>The Lights o' London</i>. The villain, too, who will
    do and dare anything (in reason) to wed the lady who has
    secured his affections, is also a novelty. So is a character
    played by Miss CLARA JECKS as only Miss CLARA JECKS can and
    does play it. And there are many more equally bright and fresh,
    and, in a word, original.</p>

    <p>So, my dear <i>Mr. Punch</i>, hasten to the Royal Adelphi
    Theatre, if you wish to see something that will either wake you
    up or send you to sleep. Go, my dear <i>Mr. Punch</i>, and sit
    out <i>The Trumpet Call</i>, and when you have seen it, you
    will understand why I sign myself,</p>

    <p>AN OLD SCHOOL BUOY.&mdash;Under the heading of "Church and
    Schools," the <i>St. James's Gazette</i> gave an interesting
    illustration of "public spirit in schools." It recounted how
    "An Old Bedford Boy"&mdash;no relation to ROBERT, the Waiter,
    we believe&mdash;in the course of returning thanks, said, "I
    have bathed in all the great rivers of the world." Then he
    added, "the water of the sluggish Ouse is the sweetest of them
    all." Oddly enough his name was "ZINCKE," though evidently he
    must be a first-rate "Zwimmer." With genuine love for his old
    school, he might have added that he wished he was a Buoy again.
    But he seems to have got on swimmingly everywhere.</p>

    <h2>THE DEMOGRAPHIC VADE MECUM.</h2>

    <p><i>Question</i>. You properly attended the Congress last
    week?</p>

    <p><i>Answer</i>. Certainly, by wearing a small brooch pinned
    on the flap of my coat.</p>

    <p><i>Q.</i> What effect had this on the cabmen?</p>

    <p><i>A.</i> To cause them to charge me just double the
    customary fares.</p>

    <p><i>Q.</i> Did you go to the Inaugural Meeting?</p>

    <p><i>A.</i> Of course, but as it was so crowded, I could get
    no further than the door.</p>

    <p><i>Q.</i> Did you hear the speech of the Prince of
    WALES?</p>

    <p><i>A.</i> Unfortunately not; but I had the advantage of
    seeing the top of his Royal Highness's head.</p>

    <p><i>Q.</i> Did you go to the <i>Soirée</i> in Lincoln's Inn
    Fields, at the Hall of the Royal College of Surgeons?</p>

    <p><i>A.</i> I did, and was much amused at finding myself
    drinking claret cup in the museum devoted to skeletons.</p>

    <p><i>Q.</i> Did you go to the reception at Guildhall?</p>

    <p><i>A.</i> Certainly, and was greatly gratified at the
    amusements supplied to the Lord Mayor's guests.</p>

    <p><i>Q.</i> What were those amusements?</p>

    <p><i>A.</i> So far as I could see, the Band of the Grenadier
    Guards, conducted by Lieut. DAN GODFREY in undress uniform,
    playing before Sir JOSEPH SAVORY, Bart.; and some charters
    under a glass case.</p>

    <p><i>Q.</i> Was that all?</p>

    <p><i>A.</i> Well, I heard some harps, and then of course there
    were the Lord Mayor's trumpeters.</p>

    <p><i>Q.</i> Did you get your hat and coat in comfort?</p>

    <p><i>A.</i> In great comfort&mdash;after I had fought like a
    wild beast with other wild beasts for an hour and a half to get
    up to the place of distribution.</p>

    <p><i>Q.</i> Was this part of the programme badly managed?</p>

    <p><i>A.</i> It was not managed at all. The City Authorities
    had not even had the sense to put the numbers available at each
    counter <i>en évidence</i>.</p>

    <p><i>Q.</i> Did you derive any linguistic learning from this
    struggle?</p>

    <p><i>A.</i> Certainly. I heard bad language in sixteen
    different tongues.</p>

    <p><i>Q.</i> And what (as a connoisseur) did you think of the
    oaths?</p>

    <p><i>A.</i> That none were comparable to that English
    expletive which is equally suggestive of a barrier in a river,
    the mother of a lamb, and the observations of an angry man.</p>

    <p><i>Q.</i> Did you go anywhere else?</p>

    <p><i>A.</i> The entertainments I attended were so numerous
    that it is impossible to remember a tithe of them.</p>

    <p><i>Q.</i> And what did you do about Science?</p>

    <p><i>A.</i> Left it for discussion until the meeting of the
    Congress to be held next year!</p>

    <p>My Amerrycane Frend has cum back again to the "Grand Hotel."
    He has bin with us nearly a month, and says he finds it, as
    before, the werry best Hotel anywheres for a jowial Bacheldore.
    I thinks as he's about the coolest card as I ever seed, tho as
    good natured as a reel Lady, and I don't think as that's at all
    a bad karacter. When he heard as the Germun EMPRER was a cummin
    to Gildhall, he acshally arsked me to interdooce him to the
    Lord MARE, as he wanted a few tickets for hisself and frends!
    And when I told him as that coudn't be manidged, he arsked
    where he coud buy a few, as he supposed as money coud buy
    anythink, and praps he wasn't so werry rong arter all. He had
    two or three Amerrycan frends to dinner the other day, and
    didn't they jest tork away. One of 'em arsked me if I didn't
    think as it was shamefoolly xtravagant to give the Lord MARE of
    our little City jest the same salary for governing his one
    little square mile, as they in Amerrykey gave their Presedent
    for governing their hole country, altho it was about thirty
    times larger than ours. To which I boldly replied most suttenly
    not, becoz I had herd as there was lots of Presedents in the
    World, but ony one Lord MARE of London, to which my frend
    shouted out, "Bravo, ROBERT, that's one to you!"</p>

    <p>Amost all their tork was about what they calls their
    "World's Show," as is to be held at Chickargo, I thinks they
    called it, the year after next, and what they have naterally
    come here for, is to arrange for the Lord MARE and his too
    Sherryffs, with their State Carridges, and state Footmen, and
    state Robes, to go over and show 'em how to open it! And the
    funniest one of the lot acshally said as I must go with 'em,
    for the World's Show woud not be a perfect show without they
    had in it the most horiginal specimen of a reel London Hed
    Waiter to show to their 50 million peeple! And I am to have the
    werry biggest tip as ever a Hed Waiter had. And I'm quite sure
    as they meant it all, for they larfed all the while as they
    torked about it.</p>

    <p>This same one had a Ticket for Guildhall the hother
    heavening, when about four thowsand gests was there, and jolly
    fun he says it was, for they all seemed to begin a drinking of
    werry good Shampane about Nine a Clock, and kep on at it for
    above three hours, for there wasn't not nothink else for 'em to
    do, and so they did that, and did it well.</p>

    <p>He arsked me if I coud remember what outlandish names the
    principal gests was all called, and when I told him I thort
    they was HIGH-GIN and DEMMY-GROGGY, they all roared again, and
    shouted out, "that's another to you ROBERT; go ahead, my
    tulip!" Tho what they meant I'm sure I don't kno.</p>

    <p>Our gentlemanly Manager looked in to see how they was a
    getting on, and when they told him what they called my last
    joke, ewen he larfed away like the best on 'em. The fust time I
    gets a chance I'll ask him to explain it all to me.</p>

    <p>What seemed to have struck the Amerrycan most, was what he
    described as the twelve most bewtifool Angels, all most
    bewtifoolly drest, in most bewtifool close, a playing most
    bewtifool toons on most bewtifool Arps! which he said reminded
    him more of Heaven than anythink he had ever seen or heard. He
    arsked me the name of the bewtifool hair as they played three
    times, and when I told him as I believed as it was a Welsh wun,
    and was called "<i>The March of the Men of Garlick</i>," he
    wonderd how men with such bad taste could have written such
    sweet music.</p>

    <p>They can tell jolly good staggerers they can! Why one on 'em
    said as how we was a getting so scrowged up in the old Country,
    that they thort of giving us jest a little slice of theirs, and
    as theirs was about thirty times as big as ours, they could
    easily spare it.</p>

    <p>But this I must and will say, they are perfect Gennelmen,
    and, as the best possibel proof of it, they is allers werry
    libbral to me.</p>

    <p>The casual reader, and the travelling reader or
    journey-alist, won't get much better entertainment for his
    money than he will find in <i>Stories of Old and New Spain</i>,
    by THOMAS A. JANVIER. No April foolin' around on the part of
    JANVIER with metaphysical digressions, but all straight to the
    point. For sensation, try <i>Saint Mary of the Angels</i>.
    Adelphi melodrama isn't in it with this story. Also in <i>San
    Antonio</i> there is a simple, quiet humour; and <i>The Legend
    of Padre José</i> is singularly touching. Altogether a book

    <h2>MUSIC FOR THE PARLIAMENTARY MILLION.</h2>

    <p>MR. FARMER-ATKINSON, M.P., has announced that during the
    Recess he will deliver political addresses interspersed with
    songs and music. To assist him we have prepared a specimen
    "utterance," which, for the sake of convenience, we have thrown
    into a dramatic form.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><i>Enter</i> Mr. FARMER-ATKINSON, M.P., <i>with an
        assortment of musical instruments which he places on a
        table in front of him. Immense applause, during which the
        Hon. Gentleman picks up a Cornet and plays a solo.
        Enthusiasm.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Mr. Farmer-Atkinson</i> (<i>bowing after recovering from
    his exertions</i>). Ladies and Gentlemen. (<i>Hear, hear!</i>)
    Thank you, Ladies and Gentlemen, for your cordial reception.
    (<i>Applause.</i>) And you must know, Ladies and Gentlemen,
    that although I have given you a solo on the cornet, I did not
    visit this flourishing town (<i>cheers</i>), this highly
    civilised town (<i>renewed applause</i>), this model town
    (<i>hearty cheering</i>), with the intention of blowing my own
    trumpet. (<i>He pauses&mdash;silence.</i>) Don't you
    understand? I did not want to blow my own trumpet&mdash;joke,
    see? (<i>A laugh.</i>) Thank you! And now about the Irish
    Question. Well everybody harps upon it. So will I. "<i>Come
    back to Erin.</i>" (<i>Plays and sings the touching
    melody&mdash;a harp accompaniment&mdash;applause.</i>) Thank
    you! And now about the Triple Alliance. Well, I think I can
    illustrate that, both musically and politically. Triple means
    three. Well, I will take this drum on my back, beating it with
    the sticks that are bound to my shoulders; then I will apply my
    mouth to this set of pipes, while I beat a triangle with my
    hands. There! (<i>Plays the musical instruments
    simultaneously&mdash;applause.</i>) Thank you! You see I get
    some sort of music. A little unattractive possibly ("<i>No!
    no!</i>"), but still sufficiently pleasing to elicit your
    admiration. ("<i>Hear, hear!</i>") Thank you! Well, this effect
    reminds me of the Triple Alliance. We may take the drum to
    represent Italy, the set of pipes Germany, always fond of
    making a shrill noise, and the triangle will ably represent
    Austria. See? (<i>Great applause.</i>) And now I am very
    unwilling to weary you further. ("<i>No, no!</i>") Thank you!
    But I myself have an appointment which I must keep, so
    therefore, I must conclude my entertainment&mdash;I should say
    speech. Otherwise you would grow weary of me? ("<i>No,
    no!</i>") Thank you! But before bidding you good-bye, I must
    sing you one more song that I think will please everybody. It
    is called "<i>Home Sweet Home</i>." (<i>Thunders of
    applause.</i>) And now I will just get the right key and fire
    away. (<i>He tunes up harp, and prepares to play.</i>) And now,
    Ladies and Gentlemen, silence please, while I sing the most
    touching song in my <i>répertoire</i>. (<i>Sings with immense
    feeling, "Home, Sweet Home</i>.") Now then, Ladies and
    Gentlemen, chorus, please&mdash;</p>

    <h2>A PENNY FRENCH&mdash;TWOPENCE BRITISH.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>A Fragment from a Romance of the G.P.O.</i>)</h4>

    <p>The youth, without a moment's hesitation, dashed manfully
    into the sea. He was watched by the excited spectators, who
    cheered him as he breasted the waves that beat against the head
    of the Admiralty Pier. It must, indeed, have been a great prize
    in view that could have caused such a daring feat. That was the
    thought of the old Coast-guardsman, as he watched the lad (he
    was scarcely more than a boy) as he took stroke after stroke
    for Calais. Now he rested on the back of a treacherous porpoise
    that soon cast him away.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:21%;">
        <a href="images/96-2.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/96-2.png"
             alt="Young swimmer." /></a>
    </div>

    <p>"Will the steamboat lend him a helping hand, or rather
    rope?" muttered the veteran salt, as he watched the seemingly
    fragile figure of the swimmer. "Ah, by Neptune! well done!
    Strike me flat with a lubberly marling-spike, but a kindly act
    indeed!"</p>

    <p>The action that had extorted the admiration of the aged
    seaman was a rope that had been thrown over the steamboat's
    bulwarks. The now weary swimmer gratefully accepted the boon.
    It saved his life.</p>

    <p>"Will you pay the difference, and come on board, young Sir?"
    asked the Captain of the packet, facetiously.</p>

    <p>"Were it not that I am very poor," gasped out the tired, and
    shivering lad, "I should not have undertaken this gigantic but
    necessary task."</p>

    <p>He held on bravely, and in good time the coast of France was
    sighted, neared, and reached. Although as cold as stone, owing
    to the exposure to the waves, the swimmer was now refreshed. He
    threw away the rope, and once more struck out.</p>

    <p>"Adieu!" he cried to the crew of the steamboat. "I can
    finish the rest of the distance without assistance."</p>

    <p>He was as good as his word. Soon he was standing on French
    ground buying a post-card for India.</p>

    <p>"And why have you come in this strange fashion?" asked an
    aged missionary of British extraction.</p>

    <p>The weary lad replied in a faint voice, "Because at Calais a
    post-card to India costs a penny, at Dover twopence! Yet both
    posts surely are conveyed by the same mail. By swimming from
    Dover to Calais I have saved a penny!" And as he recorded this
    undoubted fact he fainted.</p>

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
